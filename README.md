Gamma & Hadron Particle Classifier (or Analysis Tool)
A Django-based web application designed to visualize, analyze, or classify Gamma rays and Hadron particles based on atmospheric shower data (e.g., from the MAGIC telescope dataset).

🔬 Project Overview
This project provides a platform to process high-energy physics data. It distinguishes between high-energy gamma rays (signal) and hadronic showers (background noise) using [mention your method, e.g., Machine Learning / Statistical Analysis].

Key Features
Data Ingestion: Upload and process CSV or ROOT files containing particle parameters.

Visualization: Interactive plots showing the differences in "Hillas parameters" (Width, Length, Size, etc.).

Real-time Classification: A web interface to input particle attributes and get an instant classification result.

Scientific Dashboard: Summary statistics of detected events.
